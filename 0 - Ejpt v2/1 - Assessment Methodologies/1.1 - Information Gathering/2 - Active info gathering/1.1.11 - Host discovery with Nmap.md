Nmap can be use to enum hosts inside a network. The default host discovery done with -sn consists of an ICMP echo request, TCP SYN to port 443, TCP ACK to port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request by default. *Needs to be executed as root to work well*

```
sudo nmap -sn network
```

Another tool is netdiscover:

```
sudo netdiscover -i interface -r network
```
